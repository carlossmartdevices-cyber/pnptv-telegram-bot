## ✨ Text Formatting

```
*bold*                = **bold**
_italic_              = *italic*
~strikethrough~       = ~~strikethrough~~
`code`                = `code`
[Link Text](URL)      = clickable link
```

**WORKS:**  
`*Check this out*`  
`_Super important:_`  
`[Click Here](https://pnptv.app)`

**DOESN'T WORK:**  
`**bold**` ← Use `*bold*` instead
