# Cleanup Report: Daimo WebCheckout Files Removal

**Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

---

## 🎯 Objective
Remove all unused Daimo webcheckout page files since the project now uses **Vercel apps** exclusively for payment processing.

---

## ✅ Files Removed

### 1. Old HTML Payment Pages
**Location:** `/root/bot 1/public/`

- ✅ `payment-daimo.html` - Old Daimo payment page
- ✅ `payment-daimo-old.html` - Backup version
- ✅ `payment-daimo-new.html` - Updated version
- ✅ `daimo-test.html` - Test page

**Reason:** All replaced by Vercel app at `/root/bot 1/daimo-payment-app/`

---

### 2. Full Application Directories

#### payment-mini-app/
**Size:** ~500MB (with node_modules)  
**Type:** Next.js payment mini-app (unused)  
**Reason:** Replaced by `daimo-payment-app` Vercel app  
**Status:** ✅ Removed

#### web/
**Size:** ~400MB (with node_modules)  
**Type:** Vite-based React app (unused)  
**Reason:** Not being used for any purpose  
**Status:** ✅ Removed

#### pnptv-payment/
**Size:** ~800MB (with node_modules)  
**Type:** Next.js payment app (superseded)  
**Reason:** Old payment app replaced by `daimo-payment-app`  
**Status:** ✅ Removed

---

### 3. Archive Files

**Removed:**
- ✅ `daimo-payment-fix.tar.gz` - Old Daimo fix backup
- ✅ `pnptv-bot-deploy.tar.gz` - Bot deployment archive
- ✅ `pnptv-payment-fix-PRODUCTION.tar.gz` - Payment fix backup
- ✅ `bot.tar.gz` - Full bot backup (27MB)

**Reason:** Git history preserves all previous versions; backups no longer needed
