# This repository now stores canonical env examples under the pnptv-payment
# subfolder. The root-level `.env.example` has been cleared to prevent
# accidental commits of sensitive defaults and to reduce confusion.
#
# Canonical examples:
#   /root/Bots/pnptv-payment/.env.example
#   /root/Bots/ENV_VARS_UNIFIED.example
#
# Use Vercel environment variables or a secure secret manager to store
# production credentials. Do NOT commit real secrets to this repo.
