## ⏰ Scheduler

### How It Works

```
Every 30 seconds:
  1. Check broadcasts where:
     - status = "pending"
     - scheduledTime <= now
  2. For each broadcast:
     ├─ Get filtered users
     ├─ Send to each (100ms delay)
     ├─ Track stats
     └─ Update status → "sent"
  3. Log results
```

### Timeline

```
Scheduled: 14:30:00
Check runs: 14:30:15
Execution: 14:30:16 - 14:31:40 (for 1000 users)
Complete: 14:31:40
Status: "sent" ✅
```
