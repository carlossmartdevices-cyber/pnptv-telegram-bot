## How to Push to GitHub

You have 2 options:

### Option 1: Using GitHub Personal Access Token (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Create Token
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name it: "Bots Deployment"
4. Select scopes: ✅ `repo` (full control)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again!)

#### Step 2: Push with Token
```bash
# Set the remote URL with token (one-time setup)
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/carlossmartdevices-cyber/Bots.git

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_TOKEN`** with the token you just created.

### Option 2: Using SSH (More Secure)

#### Step 1: Generate SSH Key
```bash
# Generate new SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/github_key

# Press Enter for no passphrase (or set one)

# Copy public key
cat ~/.ssh/github_key.pub
```

#### Step 2: Add to GitHub
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/keys
2. Click "New SSH key"
3. Title: "Hostinger Server"
4. Paste the key from above
5. Click "Add SSH key"

#### Step 3: Configure Git
```bash
# Change remote to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:carlossmartdevices-cyber/Bots.git

# Add SSH key to agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/github_key

# Test connection
ssh -T git@github.com

# Push
git push origin main
```

---

### Option 3: Quick Push from Local Machine

If you have GitHub access on your local computer:

```bash
# On local machine
cd /path/to/your/Bots/folder

# Pull latest from server
git pull

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

## Need Help?

If you get authentication errors, use **Option 1** (Personal Access Token) - it's the easiest for quick pushes.

Remember to keep your token safe and never commit it to the repository!
