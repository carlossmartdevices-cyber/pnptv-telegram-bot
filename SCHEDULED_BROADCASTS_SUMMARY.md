## ⏰ Scheduler Details

### Execution Flow

Every 30 seconds:
  1. Query broadcasts where:
     - status = "pending"
     - scheduledTime <= now
  2. For each broadcast:
     ├─ Get filtered users
     ├─ Send message (100ms delay)
     ├─ Track stats
     └─ Update status → "sent"
  3. Log results
```

### Timing

```
Scheduled: 14:30:00
Check runs: 14:30:15 (±30 sec)
Sending: 14:30:16 - 14:31:40
Status update: 14:31:40
```

### Rate Limiting

```
100ms between each user send
1,000 users = ~100 seconds
5,000 users = ~500 seconds
10,000 users = ~1000 seconds
```
