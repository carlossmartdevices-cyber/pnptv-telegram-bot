- âœ… Check bot logs for errors

### Personality choice button doesn't work
- âœ… Check `personalityHandler.js` is imported in `bot.js`
- âœ… Check callback query handler exists
- âœ… Verify Firebase permissions

### Scheduled events don't trigger
- âœ… Check cron expressions are valid
- âœ… Ensure bot is running continuously
- âœ… Check server timezone

### Admin commands not working
- âœ… Verify user is **admin** or **creator** in group
- âœ… Check command syntax matches exactly
- âœ… Check logs for error messages
