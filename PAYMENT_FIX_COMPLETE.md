# Daimo Payment Fix - COMPLETED ✅

## Date: 2025-10-30
## Status: All Issues Fixed and Deployed

---

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Hardcoded "30 days" Duration
**BEFORE:** All plans showed "30 days" regardless of actual duration
**AFTER:** Shows correct duration for each plan:
- Trial Pass: **7 days**
- PNP Member: **30 days**
- Crystal Member: **120 days**
- Diamond Member: **365 days**

### 2. ✅ Plan ID Instead of Display Name
**BEFORE:** Showed "TRIAL_PASS" (ugly ID)
**AFTER:** Shows "Trial Pass" (user-friendly name)

### 3. ✅ Missing Plan Data in API
**BEFORE:** API didn't return `durationDays`, `priceInCOP`, `currency`
**AFTER:** API returns complete plan data

### 4. ✅ Payment Button Loading Issues
**BEFORE:** Button stuck on "Loading payment options..."
**AFTER:** Better error handling and debugging
