```bash
# Check scheduler initialized
pm2 logs pnptv-bot | grep "Scheduled broadcast executor initialized"

# Test creating a broadcast
# 1. Open admin panel
# 2. Click "📅 Scheduled"
# 3. Create test broadcast for 5 minutes from now
# 4. Wait for execution
# 5. Verify logs show "marked as sent"
```

   - Error handling
   - Rate limiting
   - Audit trail
   - Statistics tracking

5. **Scalable**
   - Supports thousands of users
   - Efficient filtering
   - Proven rate limiting

---

## 🔐 Security Features

1. **Admin-Only Access**
   - Only verified admins can schedule
   - No user-accessible broadcast scheduling

2. **Input Validation**
   - Date must be in future
   - Valid date format required
   - Message length limits enforced

3. **Audit Trail**
   - All broadcasts tracked by admin ID
   - Creation timestamp recorded
   - Execution details logged

4. **Error Handling**
   - Failed broadcasts logged
   - User blocking handled gracefully
   - Network errors tracked

---

## 🚀 Performance

### Throughput

```
1,000 users → ~100 seconds
5,000 users → ~500 seconds (~8 min)
10,000 users → ~1000 seconds (~17 min)

Formula: (users × 100ms) = time
```

### Optimization

- Use language filtering to reduce targets
- Schedule during off-peak hours
- Keep broadcast count under 5 when possible

**Issue:** "Limit of 12 reached"
- **Solution:** Cancel old broadcasts or wait for execution

- **Solution:** Use DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM format (e.g., 25/12/2024 14:30)

### Debug Commands

```bash
# View logs
pm2 logs pnptv-bot --lines 100 | grep broadcast

# Check Firestore
firebase firestore:get scheduledBroadcasts

# Restart bot
pm2 restart pnptv-bot
