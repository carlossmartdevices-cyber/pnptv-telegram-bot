## 🔧 HOW IT WORKS

### Execution Flow

```
Admin Schedule Phase:
  1. User clicks 📅 Scheduled
  2. Enters date/time: 25/12/2024 14:30
  3. Configures: language, status, media, message, buttons
  4. Saves to Firestore
  ✅ Status: "pending"

Scheduler Phase (every 30 seconds):
  1. Query broadcasts where:
     - status = "pending"
     - scheduledTime <= now
  2. For each broadcast:
     ├─ Get filtered users
     ├─ Send to each (100ms rate limit)
     ├─ Track: sent, failed, skipped
     └─ Update status → "sent"
  3. Save statistics
  ✅ Status: "sent" or "failed"

Admin Review Phase:
  1. User clicks 📅 Scheduled
  2. Can view sent broadcasts
  3. Can see statistics
  4. Can schedule more
```

### Example Timeline

```
Scheduled: 14:30:00 (2:30 PM)
Check 1: 14:30:15 - Not yet checked
Check 2: 14:30:30 - Checks, finds broadcast
Sending: 14:30:31 - Starts sending
Sending: 14:31:40 - For 1000 users (~100 seconds)
Complete: 14:31:40 - Status → "sent"
Stats: Sent 1000, Failed 0, Skipped 3
```

**"Broadcast not executing"**
- Solution: Check bot running, verify time passed, check logs

### Debug Commands

```bash
# View logs
pm2 logs pnptv-bot | grep broadcast

# Check Firestore
firebase firestore:get scheduledBroadcasts

# Restart bot
pm2 restart pnptv-bot

# View specific broadcast
firebase firestore:get scheduledBroadcasts/{broadcastId}
