# Membership Management Updated ✅

**Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Commit:** 5fe9b5c  
**Status:** ✅ OPERATIONAL

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Legacy Tier References**
- ❌ Deleted all mentions of "Silver" tier (was 30-day alias for PNP Member)
- ❌ Deleted all mentions of "Golden" tier (was 120-day alias for PNP Crystal)
- ✅ Kept only current active plans

### 2. **Updated Admin Tier Selection**
**File:** `/src/bot/handlers/admin.js`

**Old UI (Limited):**
```
- ⚪ Free
- [Cancel]
```

**New UI (Complete):**
```
- ⏱️ Trial Week - 7 days
- ⭐ PNP Member - 30 days
- 💎 PNP Crystal - 120 days
- 👑 PNP Diamond - 365 days
- ⚪ Free (no expiration)
- [Cancel]
```

### 3. **Improved Callback Format**
**Old Format:** `admin_set_tier_{userId}_{tier}_{duration}`
- Problem: Fails with hyphenated tier IDs (e.g., `trial-week` split incorrectly)

**New Format:** `admin_tier:{tier}:{duration}:{userId}`
- Handles hyphenated tier IDs correctly
- Uses colons instead of underscores as delimiter
- Backward compatible with legacy format

### 4. **Updated Documentation**
**File:** `MEMBERSHIP_MANAGEMENT.md`
- Removed Silver/Golden references
- Added all 5 current tier options
- Updated examples and usage instructions

## Technical Implementation

### Code Changes

**File:** `src/bot/handlers/admin.js`

**Changes:**
1. `editUserTier()` function - Now displays all 5 plan options with icons
2. New callback handler for `admin_tier:` format
3. Maintained backward compatibility with legacy `admin_set_tier_` format
4. Proper handling of hyphenated tier IDs

**Tier Name Mapping:**
```javascript
'trial-week'      → Trial Week (7 days)
'pnp-member'      → PNP Member (30 days)
'crystal-member'  → PNP Crystal (120 days)
'diamond-member'  → PNP Diamond (365 days)
'free'            → Free (no expiration)
```

### Integration with Membership Manager

The `activateMembership()` function is called with:
```javascript
activateMembership(
  userId,        // String
  tier,          // One of the tier IDs above
  'admin',       // Activation source
  durationDays   // Days until expiration (0 for Free)
)
```

**Returns:**
```javascript
{
  expiresAt: Date,      // Expiration date (null for Free)
  inviteLink: String,   // Channel invite link
  activatedAt: Date
}
```

---

## Backward Compatibility

**Legacy Format Support:**
The system still supports the old `admin_set_tier_` callback format for compatibility:
```javascript
// Old format still works
admin_set_tier_{userId}_{tier}_{duration}

// New format preferred
admin_tier:{tier}:{duration}:{userId}
```

Both formats route to the same `setUserTier()` function.
